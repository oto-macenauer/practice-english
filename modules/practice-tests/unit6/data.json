The water is warm and very clear, so you can see the colourful fish and coral under the water.\n\nMany people visit the Great Barrier Reef every year. They go snorkelling and diving to see the beautiful animals and plants under the sea. Some people take boat trips to see the reef from above.\n\nBut the Great Barrier Reef is in danger. The water is getting warmer because of climate change. When the water is too warm, the coral turns white and dies.

Iceland also has many geysers. A geyser is a hole in the ground where hot water shoots up into the air. The most famous geyser in Iceland is called Strokkur. It erupts every 6 to 10 minutes!\n\nIn winter, the days in Iceland are very short. In December, there are only about 4 hours of daylight. But you can see the Northern Lights — beautiful green, purple and pink lights that dance across the sky at night.\n\nIn summer, it is the opposite. The sun almost never goes down!

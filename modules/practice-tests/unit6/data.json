'The history of Turkey is very interesting. It was part of the Ottoman Empire!'\n\n'Freddy's group's doing their project about that,' said Katy. 'What about science?'\n\n'No,' said Harold. He didn't like science. 'The project's for Friday,' she said. 'Let's hurry up!'\n\nKaty looked at her timetable. 'I'm sure that Turkey has lots of stories and myths. These can teach us a lot about a place. Our project can be about Turkish literature.'\n\n'Great idea! We should find one on the Internet. Mr Carlton likes us to use IT,' said Mike.\n\n'Why don't we do something original, like re-write the story as a poem? I'm good at writing poems,' said Katy. 'Mike's good at art. He can draw the pictures. And you're good at acting, Harold. You can read it to the class!'\n\n'Perfect,' said Mike. So that's what they did!",

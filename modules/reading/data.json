          "passage": "Cappadocia, Turkey, is different from any other place on Earth. It is a very high area: over 1,000 metres above the sea. There are many mountains across this area which are thousands of years old and made from volcanic rock. Some of these mountains are really high. Mt Kayseri, which is the highest, is 3,916 metres!\n\nBecause Cappadocia is so high, the weather can change a lot. It can be very hot some days and very cold other days.\n\nThe people who lived in Cappadocia many years ago made small houses inside the mountains and rocks. You should visit it because you can explore inside the mountains and see how the people lived!",
